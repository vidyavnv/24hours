Hello!
It's nice of you to take the time to get to know us better. Here are some things about us that we thought you might like to know.

24hours went live in 2012 with the objective of making books easily available to anyone who had internet access. Today, we're present across various categories including movies, music, games, mobiles, cameras, computers, healthcare and personal products, home appliances and electronics, stationery, perfumes, toys â€“ and still counting!

With over 2 book titles, 4 different categories, more than 18 registered users and sale of 17 items a day, we can say with utmost confidence that we are one of the leading e-commerce players in the country.

We believe that our success is largely due to our obsession with providing our customers a memorable online shopping experience. Be it our path-breaking services like Cash on Delivery, a 30-day replacement policy, free shipping - and of course the great prices that we offer. Then there's our dedicated 24hours delivery team that works round the clock to personally make sure packages reach on time. For now they're present in 37 lucky cities, but don't worry, plans are underway to spread to many others.

So it's no surprise that we're a favourite online shopping destination.

And it's all thanks to you!</p>
